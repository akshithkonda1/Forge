// ForgeCore — shared foundation for the Forge iOS app and ForgeWatch.
//
// Everything in here is deliberately UI-framework-light: design tokens,
// readiness math, mindfulness practice definitions, the context-aware
// suggestion engine, and thin HealthKit query helpers. The suggestion
// engine and readiness calculator are pure Swift so they can be unit
// tested without a device or simulator.
